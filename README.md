# SIGFM

SIGFM stands for "SIFT Is Good For Matching"

This is a new fingerprint matcher algorithm designed for low resolution sensors.

This algo aims to replace [libfprint](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint)'s default matching algorithm.

It uses SIFT at its core.

SIGFM is meant to work with 64x80 images but it may works with other resolutions.
